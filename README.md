## üîç **What Is a Roblox Evade Script?**  

Roblox Evade scripts are custom pieces of code that modify gameplay mechanics, giving players advantages like:  
‚úî **Auto-evasion** (dodging obstacles automatically)  
‚úî **Speed hacks** (moving faster than normal)  
‚úî **Invisibility glitches** (avoiding detection)

‚ö† **Note:** Always download scripts from trusted sources to avoid malware.  

### üõ† **Step 2: Choose an Executor**

- **Electron** (User-friendly, low detection risk)  
- **Fluxus** (Lightweight, frequent updates)  
- **JJSploit** (Beginner-friendly)  

### üöÄ **Step 3: Inject & Execute**  
1. **Launch Roblox** and open **Evade**.  
2. **Run your executor as Administrator** (required for most injectors).  
3. **Attach the executor** to Roblox (usually via an "Attach" button).  
4. **Copy & paste your script** into the executor‚Äôs text box.  
5. **Press Execute** and enjoy your new powers!

## üîí **Staying Safe While Scripting**  
While scripts can be fun, they come with risks:  
- **Account bans** (Roblox detects many exploits).  
- **Viruses** (fake scripts can contain malware).  
- **Unfair gameplay** (some servers may kick script users).  

### ‚úÖ **Best Practices:**  
‚úî Use a **throwaway Roblox account** to avoid bans.  
‚úî **Scan scripts** with VirusTotal before running.  
‚úî Avoid **obvious cheating** (being too fast/invisible gets reported).
